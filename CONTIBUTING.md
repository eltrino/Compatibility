# How to contribute

## Adding new features and coverage

* All improvements should be submitted as Github issues
* We prefer that all code will pass PSR-1 & PSR-2
* Pull requests should be submitted to master branch
* If possible include tests for new functionality
* New features should include updates to documentation

Donâ€™t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around 2 days

## Documentation

Documentation for existing functionality could be improved in the same way as new features

 * All improvements should be submitted as Github issues
 * Pull requests should be submitted to master branch
